# Synesthesia Composer

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@synesthesia-project/composer.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@synesthesia-project/composer)

This is the composer part of the synesthesia project.

## Building / Usage

The main way in which to use this project is as a chrome extension (but the
html files output in `dist/` can also be used directly).

To Build:

* Run `yarn install && yarn run build`

This output of the build is put in `dist/`, and you can either open
`dist/index.html` directly in your browser, or install the `dist/` directory as
a chrome extension (which gives you more functionality such as connecting to
google play music).

## TODO list

Please see the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/synesthesia-project/synesthesia/issues) for the list of
tasks.

## Special Thanks

The style of this app has been heavily inspired by the
[Vertex Theme for GTK](https://github.com/horst3180/vertex-theme)
